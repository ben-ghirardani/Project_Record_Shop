to do :

add new artist

add new album, and have a drop down of options based on artists. Need to bring in Artists.all into the Album erb.
 
*** The Index is technically neither album not artist. Should it be seperate, not in albums.

Create a page to show new artists. Go from create new artist to here, with a link back to stock. From the new artist page you can then create a new album. One that is done it will automatically end up on the stock page as that is already set up to account for that.
